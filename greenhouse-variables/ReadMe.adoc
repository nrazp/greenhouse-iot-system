= Project: Greenhouse IoT System

This IoT project involves the use of an ESP32 microcontroller connected to Arduino Cloud to monitor and control various aspects of a greenhouse environment. 

== Step 1: Installation

1. Download the files or view them at the Arduino IoT Plataform (https://create.arduino.cc/editor/n-raz-p/6c210098-bce5-475b-93c0-c5acf8e1dcf1/preview)
2. Upload them at your Arduino IoT Cloud
3. Upload to your project
3. Release to the World!

== Step 2: Assemble the circuit

Assemble the circuit as the viewed in the main README file

== Step 3: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board
