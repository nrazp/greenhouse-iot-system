# greenhouse-iot-system

Project Overview:
This IoT project involves the use of an ESP32 microcontroller connected to Arduino Cloud to monitor and control various aspects of a greenhouse environment. The ESP32 is equipped with sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Additionally, it's capable of controlling a water pump to hydrate the plants as needed. The Arduino IoT Cloud serves as the central platform for data visualization and remote control of the water pump.
# Motivation for the Greenhouse Monitoring and Automation Project
In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on sustainable agriculture and food production methods. Greenhouses play a vital role in this movement by providing controlled environments for plant growth, allowing for year-round cultivation and optimized resource utilization. However, traditional greenhouse management methods often rely on manual monitoring and intervention, which can be labor-intensive, inefficient, and prone to human error.

The motivation behind the Greenhouse Monitoring and Automation Project stems from the need to address these challenges and leverage technology to create more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices. By integrating Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as the ESP32 microcontroller and Arduino IoT Cloud platform, this project aims to revolutionize greenhouse management.
