# greenhouse-iot-system

Project Overview:
This IoT project involves the use of an ESP32 microcontroller connected to Arduino Cloud to monitor and control various aspects of a greenhouse environment. The ESP32 is equipped with sensors to measure temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. Additionally, it's capable of controlling a water pump to hydrate the plants as needed. The Arduino IoT Cloud serves as the central platform for data visualization and remote control of the water pump.
